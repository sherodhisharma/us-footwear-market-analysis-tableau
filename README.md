# US Footwear Market Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)
## 1. Topic
Executive-level analysis of the U.S. footwear retail market (2021) using interactive Tableau dashboards to support strategic decisions on store expansion, product focus, and sales channel optimisation.

## 2. Executive Summary
This project delivers a data-driven analysis of U.S. footwear sales using Adidas transaction data from 2021. Through structured data cleaning and interactive Tableau dashboards, the analysis provides actionable insights into regional demand patterns, product performance, sales channel efficiency, and retailer profitability.

The dashboards were designed for executive stakeholders to support informed decisions on where to open new stores, which product categories to prioritise, and how to balance physical and online sales strategies. Key findings highlight strong regional demand in the Northeast, dominance of men’s athletic footwear, and higher operating margins in online sales channels.

## 3. Business Problem
FootwearTech is planning to expand its presence in the United States but faces uncertainty around:
- Optimal store locations
- Most profitable product categories
- Effective sales and distribution channels
- Competitive positioning against established retailers

Without clear insights, expansion decisions risk poor location selection, inefficient pricing strategies, and misaligned product offerings. This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw sales data into decision-ready intelligence.
